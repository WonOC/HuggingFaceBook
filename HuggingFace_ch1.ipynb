Tokyo was selected as the host city during the 125th IOC Session in Buenos Aires, Argentina on 7 September 2013.[3]\n","Originally scheduled to take place from 24 July to 9 August 2020, the event was postponed to 2021 on 24 March 2020 due to the global COVID-19 pandemic,\n","the first such instance in the history of the Olympic Games (several previous games had been cancelled but not rescheduled).[4][5] However, the event retained the Tokyo 2020 branding for marketing purposes.[6]\n","It was largely held behind closed doors with no public spectators permitted due to the declaration of a state of emergency in the Greater Tokyo Area in response to the pandemic,\n"," the only Olympic Games to be held without official spectators.[f] The Games were the most expensive ever, with total spending of over $20 billion.[8]\n","The Games were the fourth Olympic Games to be held in Japan, following the 1964 Summer Olympics (Tokyo), 1972 Winter Olympics (Sapporo), and 1998 Winter Olympics (Nagano).\n","Tokyo became the first city in Asia to hold the Summer Olympic Games twice.[g] The 2020 Games were the second of three consecutive Olympics to be held in East Asia, following the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang,\n","South Korea and preceding the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, China. Due to the one-year postponement, Tokyo 2020 was the only Olympic Games to have been held in an odd-numbered year.[10]\n","New events were introduced in existing sports, including 3x3 basketball, freestyle BMX and mixed gender team events in a number of existing sports,\n","as well as the return of madison cycling for men and an introduction of the same event for women. New IOC policies also allowed the host organizing committee to add new sports to the Olympic program for just one Games.\n","The disciplines added by the Japanese Olympic Committee were baseball and softball, karate, sport climbing, surfing and skateboarding, the last four of which made their Olympic debuts, and the last three of which will remain on the Olympic program.[11]\n","The United States topped the medal table both by gold (39) and total medals (113), with China finishing second (38 and 89).
